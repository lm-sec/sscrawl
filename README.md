# SSCrawl

A multi-threaded Secret Server Crawler. It uses the initial credentials to connect to the secret server and reads all credentials and files. It then tries to re-login recursively with the found credentials. Secrets tree graphs are generated for better access visualisation.

## Supported Servers

* Delinea Secret Server (formerly Thycotic)
* HashiCorp Vault

```

### Examples

Non-recursive search with a HashiCorp username and password login, without graph generation :

```bash
python3 sscrawl.py --user 'User01' -p 'password01' --server 'hashicorp' --url "http://192.168.59.104:8200"
```

Recursive search with a HashiCorp approle login, with graph generation :

```bash
python3 sscrawl.py --user 'aafab6b2-4de6-b72f-d8b2-e7c95d1d162a' -p '75091e8c-0c11-510e-b1e3-e87ddd50c27c' --server 'hashicorp' --url "http://192.168.59.104:8200" --graph --recursive
```
